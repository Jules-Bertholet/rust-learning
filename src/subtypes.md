# Get a feel for variance, references, and reborrows

[Here's some official docs on the topic of variance,](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/subtyping.html)
but reading it may make you go cross-eyed.   As an alternative, in this section I attempt to introduce some basic
rules about how references work with regard to lifetimes over the course of a few layers.

If it still makes you cross-eyed, just skim or skip ahead.
